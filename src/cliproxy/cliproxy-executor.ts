 * - executor/lifecycle-manager.ts - Spawn/kill/poll operations
 * - executor/env-resolver.ts - Environment variable resolution
 * - executor/retry-handler.ts - Error recovery and retry logic
 * - executor/session-bridge.ts - Session tracking integration
 *
 * @deprecated Import from './executor' instead
